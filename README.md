### Week 4 Homework
**About This Homework**

This project is a fun and interactive game for web browsers. The app dynamically updates the HTML pages with the jQuery library.

How to Play:

You will be given the random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals provided. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to a random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.
